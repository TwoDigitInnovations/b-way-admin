### 🛠️ Creating Routes with Map Data

When creating new routes:

1. **Fill in Addresses** - The system will automatically find coordinates
2. **Add Stops** - Include intermediate stops for better routing
3. **Save Route** - The system calculates optimal path and geometry
4. **View Results** - Check the map to verify the route looks correct

### 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Complete Addresses** - Include city, state for better geocoding
2. **Check Maps After Creation** - Verify routes look correct
3. **Update if Needed** - Edit routes if coordinates seem off
4. **Use Status Updates** - Mark routes as Active/Completed/Archive

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### With AWS Location Service
- Real coordinates from address geocoding
- Actual route calculation with turn-by-turn directions
- Accurate distance and time estimates
- Professional map tiles and styling

#### Fallback Mode (No AWS)
- Mock coordinates based on major cities
- Straight-line route approximations  
- Estimated distances and times
- Still fully functional for route management

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

#### Map Not Loading?
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify route has valid address data
